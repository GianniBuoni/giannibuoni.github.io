# Hi, it's me—ya boye, Jon!
Sillyness meets cerebral: I'm currently working on building a new portfolio site for myself. My old site is [here](https://jonsimeon.com/).

Illustrator, designer, jigsaw-puzzle lover—my naturally cuerious mind takes me many places and down a myriad rabbit hole of thoughts and ruminations. When I'm not being creative, you can find me messing with coffee brewing techniques, playing video games, or hanging out and walking with my beloved doggo-roni, Noodle (short for: Noode the Doodle das Poopington III, First of Their Name [sic]).

- Born in the Philippines and grew up in California, I now live in Massachoo-choo.
- Graduated with a BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2015.
- Currently working at [Charlesbridge](https://www.charlesbridge.com/).

# Look, I made this!
This was a real fun challenge to put together. I currently work in book publishing, but love to dabble and explore all paradigms and methods of communcation!
