# Hi, it's meâ€”ya boye, Jon!
Sillyness meets cerebral: I'm currently working on building a new portfolio site for myself.
I'm a book designer by trade, but love to dabble with other paradigms of communcation.

# Look, I'm making it!
Challenging myself to make a maintainable website from scratch as one of my 2024 goals.
- My super old portfolio is [here](https://jonsimeon.com).
- Built using simple HTML, SCSS, and a dash of JQuery.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages, and maintained with Jekyll.
- JQuery scripts use the fabulous **Masonry** and **imagesLoaded** plugins by [Dave DeSandro](https://desandro.com/).
